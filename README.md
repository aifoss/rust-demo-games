# rust-demo-games

Demo game app programs written in Rust.

Each game (invaders, car_and_barrels, or road_race) can be started by issuing `cargo run`.

To play invaders, use the space bar to shoot invaders while using arrow keys to move left/right.

To play car_and_barrels, use arrow keys to move the blue car and remove the red barrels.

To play road_race, use arrows keys to move the blue car to avoid collision with obstacles on the road.
